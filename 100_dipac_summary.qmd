## Introduction

This report is an analysis of Chinook salmon egg thiamine. Eggs were collected
from returning Chinook salmon at DIPAC's Macaulay Hatchery in Juneau, AK on
2025-08-15.

For this analysis, individuals with eggs containing less than 5 nmol thiamine
per gram are considered to be "thiamine deficient", this is the consensus literature
value for deficient eggs. 

### Glossary of Variables

`mid-eye-fork-length`
: The length in millimeters for each fish, taken from the middle of the eye 
to the fork in the caudal fin.

`avg_egg_mass_g`
: The average mass of the eggs sampled for thiamine for each fish, measured in grams. 
Determined by dividing the total mass of the eggs sampled by the number of eggs sampled 
for thiamine analysis.

`total_egg_mass_g`
: The total mass of eggs, in grams, for each fish, measured at DIPAC after 
fertilization and water hardening.

`est_fecund_n`
: The total estimated fecundity, representing the total number of eggs produced 
by each female. Provided by Arthur Hamlett, DIPAC. 

`nmolT_g`
: Nanomoles of thiamine per gram of egg.

`nmolT_egg`
: Nanomoles of thiamine per egg.

Of the 58 females we measured eggs from (2 BKD positive fish removed), 16 (27.6 %)
fall below the established offspring mortality benchmark (5.0 nmol T/g). We have
enough individuals classified as "deficient" that we should be able to determine
if this 5.0 nmol T/g benchmark is accurate for Andrew Creek Chinook salmon.

## Andrew Creek Stock Thiamine Concentrations

![Andrew Creek stock Chinook salmon thiamine concentrations. The dashed red line indicates 5 nmol T/g, the threshold for deficient eggs.](output/plots/andrew_creek_thiamine_conc_yearly.png)
Looks to be a decreasing trend over the years, though sample size is limited
before 2024.
